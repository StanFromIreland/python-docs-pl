"Everything started with a post by Samuele Pedroni to the Python development "
"mailing list [#]_.  In his post, Samuele showed that the Python 2.2 method "
"resolution order is not monotonic and he proposed to replace it with the C3 "
"method resolution order.  Guido agreed with his arguments and therefore now "
"Python 2.3 uses C3.  The C3 method itself has nothing to do with Python, "
"since it was invented by people working on Dylan and it is described in a "
"paper intended for lispers [#]_.  The present paper gives a (hopefully) "
"readable discussion of the C3 algorithm for Pythonistas who want to "
"understand the reasons for the change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First of all, let me point out that what I am going to say only applies to "
"the *new style classes* introduced in Python 2.2:  *classic classes* "
"maintain their old method resolution order, depth first and then left to "
"right.  Therefore, there is no breaking of old code for classic classes; and "
"even if in principle there could be breaking of code for Python 2.2 new "
"style classes, in practice the cases in which the C3 resolution order "
"differs from the Python 2.2 method resolution order are so rare that no real "
"breaking of code is expected.  Therefore:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Don't be scared!*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moreover, unless you make strong use of multiple inheritance and you have "
"non-trivial hierarchies, you don't need to understand the C3 algorithm, and "
"you can easily skip this paper.  On the other hand, if you really want to "
"know how multiple inheritance works, then this paper is for you.  The good "
"news is that things are not as complicated as you might expect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let me begin with some basic definitions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given a class C in a complicated multiple inheritance hierarchy, it is a non-"
"trivial task to specify the order in which methods are overridden, i.e. to "
"specify the order of the ancestors of C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The list of the ancestors of a class C, including the class itself, ordered "
"from the nearest ancestor to the furthest, is called the class precedence "
"list or the *linearization* of C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Method Resolution Order* (MRO) is the set of rules that construct the "
"linearization.  In the Python literature, the idiom \"the MRO of C\" is also "
"used as a synonymous for the linearization of the class C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For instance, in the case of single inheritance hierarchy, if C is a "
"subclass of C1, and C1 is a subclass of C2, then the linearization of C is "
"simply the list [C, C1 , C2].  However, with multiple inheritance "
"hierarchies, the construction of the linearization is more cumbersome, since "
"it is more difficult to construct a linearization that respects *local "
"precedence ordering* and *monotonicity*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I will discuss the local precedence ordering later, but I can give the "
"definition of monotonicity here.  A MRO is monotonic when the following is "
"true:  *if C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of C, then C1 precedes C2 in "
"the linearization of any subclass of C*. Otherwise, the innocuous operation "
"of deriving a new class could change the resolution order of methods, "
"potentially introducing very subtle bugs.  Examples where this happens will "
"be shown later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not all classes admit a linearization.  There are cases, in complicated "
"hierarchies, where it is not possible to derive a class such that its "
"linearization respects all the desired properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here I give an example of this situation. Consider the hierarchy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"which can be represented with the following inheritance graph, where I have "
"denoted with O the ``object`` class, which is the beginning of any hierarchy "
"for new style classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, it is not possible to derive a new class C from A and B, since "
"X precedes Y in A, but Y precedes X in B, therefore the method resolution "
"order would be ambiguous in C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.3 raises an exception in this situation (TypeError:  MRO conflict "
"among bases Y, X) forbidding the naive programmer from creating ambiguous "
"hierarchies.  Python 2.2 instead does not raise an exception, but chooses an "
"*ad hoc* ordering (CABXYO in this case)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The C3 Method Resolution Order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let me introduce a few simple notations which will be useful for the "
"following discussion.  I will use the shortcut notation::"
msgstr ""

msgid "to indicate the list of classes [C1, C2, ... , CN]."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *head* of the list is its first element::"
msgstr ""

msgid "whereas the *tail* is the rest of the list::"
msgstr ""

msgid "I shall also use the notation::"
msgstr ""

msgid "to denote the sum of the lists [C] + [C1, C2, ... ,CN]."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now I can explain how the MRO works in Python 2.3."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider a class C in a multiple inheritance hierarchy, with C inheriting "
"from the base classes B1, B2, ...  , BN.  We want to compute the "
"linearization L[C] of the class C. The rule is the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*the linearization of C is the sum of C plus the merge of the linearizations "
"of the parents and the list of the parents.*"
msgstr ""

msgid "In symbolic notation::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In particular, if C is the ``object`` class, which has no parents, the "
"linearization is trivial::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in general one has to compute the merge according to the following "
"prescription:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*take the head of the first list, i.e L[B1][0]; if this head is not in the "
"tail of any of the other lists, then add it to the linearization of C and "
"remove it from the lists in the merge, otherwise look at the head of the "
"next list and take it, if it is a good head.  Then repeat the operation "
"until all the class are removed or it is impossible to find good heads.  In "
"this case, it is impossible to construct the merge, Python 2.3 will refuse "
"to create the class C and will raise an exception.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This prescription ensures that the merge operation *preserves* the ordering, "
"if the ordering can be preserved.  On the other hand, if the order cannot be "
"preserved (as in the example of serious order disagreement discussed above) "
"then the merge cannot be computed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The computation of the merge is trivial if C has only one parent (single "
"inheritance); in this case::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in the case of multiple inheritance things are more cumbersome and "
"I don't expect you can understand the rule without a couple of examples ;-)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples"
msgstr "Przyk≈Çady"

msgid "First example. Consider the following hierarchy:"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this case the inheritance graph can be drawn as:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The linearizations of O,D,E and F are trivial::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The linearization of B can be computed as::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We see that D is a good head, therefore we take it and we are reduced to "
"compute ``merge(O,EO,E)``.  Now O is not a good head, since it is in the "
"tail of the sequence EO.  In this case the rule says that we have to skip to "
"the next sequence.  Then we see that E is a good head; we take it and we are "
"reduced to compute ``merge(O,O)`` which gives O. Therefore::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the same procedure one finds::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now we can compute::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, the linearization is ordered in a pretty nice way according "
"to the inheritance level, in the sense that lower levels (i.e. more "
"specialized classes) have higher precedence (see the inheritance graph).  "
"However, this is not the general case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I leave as an exercise for the reader to compute the linearization for my "
"second example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The only difference with the previous example is the change B(D,E) --> B(E,"
"D); however even such a little modification completely changes the ordering "
"of the hierarchy:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice that the class E, which is in the second level of the hierarchy, "
"precedes the class C, which is in the first level of the hierarchy, i.e. E "
"is more specialized than C, even if it is in a higher level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A lazy programmer can obtain the MRO directly from Python 2.2, since in this "
"case it coincides with the Python 2.3 linearization.  It is enough to invoke "
"the .mro() method of class A:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, let me consider the example discussed in the first section, "
"involving a serious order disagreement.  In this case, it is straightforward "
"to compute the linearizations of O, X, Y, A and B:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, it is impossible to compute the linearization for a class C that "
"inherits from A and B::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At this point we cannot merge the lists XYO and YXO, since X is in the tail "
"of YXO whereas Y is in the tail of XYO:  therefore there are no good heads "
"and the C3 algorithm stops.  Python 2.3 raises an error and refuses to "
"create the class C."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bad Method Resolution Orders"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A MRO is *bad* when it breaks such fundamental properties as local "
"precedence ordering and monotonicity.  In this section, I will show that "
"both the MRO for classic classes and the MRO for new style classes in Python "
"2.2 are bad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is easier to start with the local precedence ordering.  Consider the "
"following example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "with inheritance diagram"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We see that class G inherits from F and E, with F *before* E:  therefore we "
"would expect the attribute *G.remember2buy* to be inherited by *F."
"rembermer2buy* and not by *E.remember2buy*:  nevertheless Python 2.2 gives"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a breaking of local precedence ordering since the order in the local "
"precedence list, i.e. the list of the parents of G, is not preserved in the "
"Python 2.2 linearization of G::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One could argue that the reason why F follows E in the Python 2.2 "
"linearization is that F is less specialized than E, since F is the "
"superclass of E; nevertheless the breaking of local precedence ordering is "
"quite non-intuitive and error prone.  This is particularly true since it is "
"a different from old style classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case the MRO is GFEF and the local precedence ordering is preserved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a general rule, hierarchies such as the previous one should be avoided, "
"since it is unclear if F should override E or vice-versa. Python 2.3 solves "
"the ambiguity by raising an exception in the creation of class G, "
"effectively stopping the programmer from generating ambiguous hierarchies.  "
"The reason for that is that the C3 algorithm fails when the merge::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"cannot be computed, because F is in the tail of EFO and E is in the tail of "
"FE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The real solution is to design a non-ambiguous hierarchy, i.e. to derive G "
"from E and F (the more specific first) and not from F and E; in this case "
"the MRO is GEF without any doubt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.3 forces the programmer to write good hierarchies (or, at least, "
"less error-prone ones)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a related note, let me point out that the Python 2.3 algorithm is smart "
"enough to recognize obvious mistakes, as the duplication of classes in the "
"list of parents:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.2 (both for classic classes and new style classes) in this "
"situation, would not raise any exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, I would like to point out two lessons we have learned from this "
"example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"despite the name, the MRO determines the resolution order of attributes, not "
"only of methods;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"the default food for Pythonistas is spam !  (but you already knew that ;-)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Having discussed the issue of local precedence ordering, let me now consider "
"the issue of monotonicity.  My goal is to show that neither the MRO for "
"classic classes nor that for Python 2.2 new style classes is monotonic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prove that the MRO for classic classes is non-monotonic is rather "
"trivial, it is enough to look at the diamond diagram:"
msgstr ""

msgid "One easily discerns the inconsistency::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the other hand, there are no problems with the Python 2.2 and 2.3 MROs, "
"they give both::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Guido points out in his essay [#]_ that the classic MRO is not so bad in "
"practice, since one can typically avoids diamonds for classic classes. But "
"all new style classes inherit from ``object``, therefore diamonds are "
"unavoidable and inconsistencies shows up in every multiple inheritance graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The MRO of Python 2.2 makes breaking monotonicity difficult, but not "
"impossible.  The following example, originally provided by Samuele Pedroni, "
"shows that the MRO of Python 2.2 is non-monotonic:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here are the linearizations according to the C3 MRO (the reader should "
"verify these linearizations as an exercise and draw the inheritance "
"diagram ;-) ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.2 gives exactly the same linearizations for A, B, C, D, E, K1, K2 "
"and K3, but a different linearization for Z::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is clear that this linearization is *wrong*, since A comes before D "
"whereas in the linearization of K3 A comes *after* D. In other words, in K3 "
"methods derived by D override methods derived by A, but in Z, which still is "
"a subclass of K3, methods derived by A override methods derived by D!  This "
"is a violation of monotonicity.  Moreover, the Python 2.2 linearization of Z "
"is also inconsistent with local precedence ordering, since the local "
"precedence list of the class Z is [K1, K2, K3] (K2 precedes K3), whereas in "
"the linearization of Z K2 *follows* K3.  These problems explain why the 2.2 "
"rule has been dismissed in favor of the C3 rule."

msgid "The end"

msgid ""
"This section is for the impatient reader, who skipped all the previous "
"sections and jumped immediately to the end.  This section is for the lazy "
"programmer too, who didn't want to exercise her/his brain. Finally, it is "
"for the programmer with some hubris, otherwise s/he would not be reading a "
"paper on the C3 method resolution order in multiple inheritance "
"hierarchies ;-) These three virtues taken all together (and *not* "
"separately) deserve a prize:  the prize is a short Python 2.2 script that "
