msgid "Type Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "The C structure of the objects used to describe built-in types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the type object for type objects; it is the same object as :class:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return non-zero if the object *o* is a type object, including instances of "
"types derived from the standard type object.  Return 0 in all other cases. "
"This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return non-zero if the object *o* is a type object, but not a subtype of the "

"succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clear the internal lookup cache. Return the current version tag."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_flags` member of *type*. This "
"function is primarily meant for use with ``Py_LIMITED_API``; the individual "
"flag bits are guaranteed to be stable across Python releases, but access to :"
"c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_flags` itself is not part of the :ref:`limited "
"API <limited-c-api>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The return type is now ``unsigned long`` rather than ``long``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the type object's internal namespace, which is otherwise only exposed "
"via a read-only proxy (:attr:`cls.__dict__ <type.__dict__>`). This is a "
"replacement for accessing :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dict` directly. The "
"returned dictionary must be treated as read-only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is meant for specific embedding and language-binding cases, "
"where direct access to the dict is necessary and indirect access (e.g. via "
"the proxy or :c:func:`PyObject_GetAttr`) isn't adequate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extension modules should continue to use ``tp_dict``, directly or "
"indirectly, when setting up their own types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Invalidate the internal lookup cache for the type and all of its subtypes.  "
"This function must be called after any manual modification of the attributes "
"or base classes of the type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Register *callback* as a type watcher. Return a non-negative integer ID "
"which must be passed to future calls to :c:func:`PyType_Watch`. In case of "

"features are denoted by single bit flags."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Return true if *a* is a subtype of *b*."
msgstr ""

"Finalize a type object.  This should be called on all type objects to finish "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If some of the base classes implements the GC protocol and the provided type "

msgid ""
"Return the function pointer stored in the given slot. If the result is "

msgstr ""

"If no module is associated with the given type, sets :py:class:`TypeError` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is usually used to get the module in which a method is "
"defined. Note that in such a method, ``PyType_GetModule(Py_TYPE(self))`` may "
"not return the intended result. ``Py_TYPE(self)`` may be a *subclass* of the "
"intended class, and subclasses are not necessarily defined in the same "
"module as their superclass. See :c:type:`PyCMethod` to get the class that "

"type:`!PyCMethod` cannot be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the state of the module object associated with the given type. This "

"If the *type* has an associated module but its state is ``NULL``, returns "

"`PyModule_GetState()` to get module state from slot methods (such as :c:"
"member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_init` or :c:member:`~PyNumberMethods.nb_add`) and "

msgstr ""

msgid "Attempt to assign a version tag to the given type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"deprecated and in Python 3.14+ such metaclasses will not be supported.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *bases* argument can be used to specify base classes; it can either be "

"*Py_tp_bases* slot is used instead. If that also is ``NULL``, the "
"*Py_tp_base* slot is used instead. If that also is ``NULL``, the new type "
"derives from :class:`object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *module* argument can be used to record the module in which the new "
"class is defined. It must be a module object or ``NULL``. If not ``NULL``, "
"the module is associated with the new type and can later be retrieved with :"
"c:func:`PyType_GetModule`. The associated module is not inherited by "
