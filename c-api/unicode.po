msgid "Unicode Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the implementation of :pep:`393` in Python 3.3, Unicode objects "
"internally use a variety of representations, in order to allow handling the "
"complete range of Unicode characters while staying memory efficient.  There "
"are special cases for strings where all code points are below 128, 256, or "
"65536; otherwise, code points must be below 1114112 (which is the full "
"Unicode range)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"UTF-8 representation is created on demand and cached in the Unicode object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :c:type:`Py_UNICODE` representation has been removed since Python 3.12 "
"with deprecated APIs. See :pep:`623` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unicode Type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are the basic Unicode object types used for the Unicode implementation "
"in Python:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These types are typedefs for unsigned integer types wide enough to contain "
"characters of 32 bits, 16 bits and 8 bits, respectively.  When dealing with "
"single Unicode characters, use :c:type:`Py_UCS4`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a typedef of :c:type:`wchar_t`, which is a 16-bit type or 32-bit "
"type depending on the platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous versions, this was a 16-bit type or a 32-bit type depending on "
"whether you selected a \"narrow\" or \"wide\" Unicode version of Python at "
"build time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These subtypes of :c:type:`PyObject` represent a Python Unicode object.  In "
"almost all cases, they shouldn't be used directly, since all API functions "
"that deal with Unicode objects take and return :c:type:`PyObject` pointers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` represents the Python Unicode type.  "
"It is exposed to Python code as ``str``."
msgstr ""

"The following APIs are C macros and static inlined functions for fast checks "
"and access to internal read-only data of Unicode objects:"

msgid ""
"Return true if the object *obj* is a Unicode object or an instance of a "
"Unicode subtype.  This function always succeeds."
