"``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides access to the metadata of "
"an installed `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_, such as its entry points or its top-"
"level names (`Import Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Import-Package>`_\\s, modules, if any). Built in part on "
"Python's import system, this library intends to replace similar "
"functionality in the `entry point API`_ and `metadata API`_ of "
"``pkg_resources``.  Along with :mod:`importlib.resources`, this package can "
"eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient ``pkg_resources`` "
"package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``importlib.metadata`` operates on third-party *distribution packages* "
"installed into Python's ``site-packages`` directory via tools such as :pypi:"
"`pip`. Specifically, it works with distributions with discoverable ``dist-"
"info`` or ``egg-info`` directories, and metadata defined by the `Core "
"metadata specifications <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are *not* necessarily equivalent to or correspond 1:1 with the top-"
"level *import package* names that can be imported inside Python code. One "
"*distribution package* can contain multiple *import packages* (and single "
"modules), and one top-level *import package* may map to multiple "
"*distribution packages* if it is a namespace package. You can use :ref:"
"`package_distributions() <package-distributions>` to get a mapping between "
"them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, distribution metadata can live on the file system or in zip "
"archives on :data:`sys.path`.  Through an extension mechanism, the metadata "

msgstr ""

msgid "This package provides the following functionality via its public API."
msgstr ""

msgid "Entry points"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry_points()`` function returns a collection of entry points. Entry "
"points are represented by ``EntryPoint`` instances; each ``EntryPoint`` has "
"a ``.name``, ``.group``, and ``.value`` attributes and a ``.load()`` method "
"to resolve the value.  There are also ``.module``, ``.attr``, and ``."
"extras`` attributes for getting the components of the ``.value`` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Query all entry points::"
msgstr ""

msgid ">>> eps = entry_points()  "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry_points()`` function returns an ``EntryPoints`` object, a "

"attributes for convenience::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> sorted(eps.groups)  \n"
"['console_scripts', 'distutils.commands', 'distutils.setup_keywords', "
"'egg_info.writers', 'setuptools.installation']"

msgid ""
"``EntryPoints`` has a ``select`` method to select entry points matching "
"specific properties. Select entry points in the ``console_scripts`` group::"
msgstr ""

msgid ">>> scripts = eps.select(group='console_scripts')  "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Equivalently, since ``entry_points`` passes keyword arguments through to "
"select::"
msgstr ""

"their definition, and usage."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"selectable\" entry points were introduced in ``importlib_metadata`` "
"3.6 and Python 3.10. Prior to those changes, ``entry_points`` accepted no "
"parameters and always returned a dictionary of entry points, keyed by group. "
"With ``importlib_metadata`` 5.0 and Python 3.12, ``entry_points`` always "
"returns an ``EntryPoints`` object. See :pypi:`backports."
"entry_points_selectable` for compatibility options."

msgid "Distribution metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/"

"org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_ name and returns all of "
"the files installed by this distribution.  Each file object returned is a "
"``PackagePath``, a :class:`pathlib.PurePath` derived object with additional "
"``dist``, ``size``, and ``hash`` properties as indicated by the metadata.  "

"In the case where the metadata file listing files (RECORD or SOURCES.txt) is "

"to ``files()`` in `always_iterable <https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/"
"stable/api.html#more_itertools.always_iterable>`_ or otherwise guard against "

msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution requirements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid ""
"Some editable installs, `do not supply top-level names <https://github.com/"

"reliable with such installs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distributions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the above API is the most common and convenient usage, you can get all "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

"By default, this package provides built-in support for discovery of metadata "
"for file system and zip file `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python."
"org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_\\s. This metadata "

msgid "Extending the search algorithm"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_ metadata is not available through :"
"data:`sys.path` searches, or package loaders directly, the metadata for a "

"By default ``importlib.metadata`` installs a finder for distribution "
"packages found on the file system. This finder doesn't actually find any "
"*distributions*, but it can find their metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The abstract class :py:class:`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` defines the "
"interface expected of finders by Python's import system. ``importlib."
"metadata`` extends this protocol by looking for an optional "
"``find_distributions`` callable on the finders from :data:`sys.meta_path` "
"and presents this extended interface as the ``DistributionFinder`` abstract "
"base class, which defines this abstract method::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``DistributionFinder.Context`` object provides ``.path`` and ``.name`` "
"properties indicating the path to search and name to match and may supply "
"other relevant context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What this means in practice is that to support finding distribution package "
"metadata in locations other than the file system, subclass ``Distribution`` "

"method."
