"This module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of "
"basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers.  Arrays are "
"sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of "
"objects stored in them is constrained.  The type is specified at object "
"creation time by using a :dfn:`type code`, which is a single character.  The "
"following type codes are defined:"

"The ``'u'`` type code corresponds to Python's obsolete unicode character (:c:"
"type:`Py_UNICODE` which is :c:type:`wchar_t`). Depending on the platform, it "
"can be 16 bits or 32 bits."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``'u'`` will be removed together with the rest of the :c:type:`Py_UNICODE` "
"API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The actual representation of values is determined by the machine "
"architecture (strictly speaking, by the C implementation).  The actual size "
"can be accessed through the :attr:`itemsize` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines the following type:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new array whose items are restricted by *typecode*, and initialized from "
"the optional *initializer* value, which must be a list, a :term:`bytes-like "
"object`, or iterable over elements of the appropriate type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If given a list or string, the initializer is passed to the new array's :"
"meth:`fromlist`, :meth:`frombytes`, or :meth:`fromunicode` method (see "
"below) to add initial items to the array.  Otherwise, the iterable "
"initializer is passed to the :meth:`extend` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``array.__new__`` with arguments "
"``typecode``, ``initializer``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A string with all available type codes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Array objects support the ordinary sequence operations of indexing, slicing, "
"concatenation, and multiplication.  When using slice assignment, the "
"assigned value must be an array object with the same type code; in all other "
"cases, :exc:`TypeError` is raised. Array objects also implement the buffer "
"interface, and may be used wherever :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like "
"object>` are supported."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following data items and methods are also supported:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The typecode character used to create the array."
msgstr ""

msgid "The length in bytes of one array item in the internal representation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Append a new item with value *x* to the end of the array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a tuple ``(address, length)`` giving the current memory address and "
"the length in elements of the buffer used to hold array's contents.  The "
"size of the memory buffer in bytes can be computed as ``array.buffer_info()"
"[1] * array.itemsize``.  This is occasionally useful when working with low-"
"level (and inherently unsafe) I/O interfaces that require memory addresses, "
"such as certain :c:func:`ioctl` operations.  The returned numbers are valid "
"as long as the array exists and no length-changing operations are applied to "
"it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using array objects from code written in C or C++ (the only way to "
"effectively make use of this information), it makes more sense to use the "
"buffer interface supported by array objects.  This method is maintained for "
"backward compatibility and should be avoided in new code.  The buffer "
"interface is documented in :ref:`bufferobjects`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Byteswap\" all items of the array.  This is only supported for values "
"which are 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes in size; for other types of values, :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised.  It is useful when reading data from a file "
"written on a machine with a different byte order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the number of occurrences of *x* in the array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Append items from *iterable* to the end of the array.  If *iterable* is "
"another array, it must have *exactly* the same type code; if not, :exc:"
"`TypeError` will be raised.  If *iterable* is not an array, it must be "
"iterable and its elements must be the right type to be appended to the array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Appends items from the string, interpreting the string as an array of "
"machine values (as if it had been read from a file using the :meth:"
"`fromfile` method)."
msgstr ""

msgid ":meth:`fromstring` is renamed to :meth:`frombytes` for clarity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Read *n* items (as machine values) from the :term:`file object` *f* and "
"append them to the end of the array.  If less than *n* items are available, :"
"exc:`EOFError` is raised, but the items that were available are still "
"inserted into the array. *f* must be a real built-in file object; something "
"else with a :meth:`read` method won't do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Append items from the list.  This is equivalent to ``for x in list: a."
"append(x)`` except that if there is a type error, the array is unchanged."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extends this array with data from the given unicode string.  The array must "
"be a type ``'u'`` array; otherwise a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.  Use "

"array of some other type."

"Return the smallest *i* such that *i* is the index of the first occurrence "

"values are treated as being relative to the end of the array."

"as ``array(typecode, initializer)``.  The *initializer* is omitted if the "
"array is empty, otherwise it is a string if the *typecode* is ``'u'``, "
